## Overview

This project automates the extraction of assessment questions, answers, and marks from DOCX files with specific styling conventions. It supports exporting the extracted data as pandas DataFrames, Word documents with proper formatting, and provides groundwork for integration with CI/CD pipelines.

---

## Features

* Parses DOCX files using heading styles (e.g., Heading 1 for chapters, Heading 2 for processes).
* Optionally cross-checks structure against the Table of Contents (TOC).
* Extracts "CONCEPT CHECK" style questions and answers from tables.
* Aggregates extracted content into structured pandas DataFrames.
* Supports exporting results into Word and Excel documents.
* Modular codebase for easy extension and maintenance.
* Cleaner, analysis, and injector modules for robust data processing.
* Future planned features:
  * File browser GUI for local file selection.
  * Printing capabilities.
  * Toggleable automation for CI/CD pipelines.
  * Template-based document injection.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or later
* pip package manager

### Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PolyglotScott/internal_assessment_extractor.git
cd internal_assessment_extractor
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Place your DOCX files in the `input/` folder.
2. Run the main script:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

By default, the script will use the first `.docx` file found in the `input/` directory.  
You can also run the parser directly and specify an input file:

```bash
python -m src.doc_parser --input input/your_document.docx
```

After parsing, the script will print a summary and can export results to Word or Excel (see `exporter.py`).

## Recent Changes

### Directory & File Structure
- **Added `templates/` directory** for storing document templates used by the injector module.
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude the `templates/` directory and all `.docx` files, except for `templates/assessment_template.docx` and `sample_outputs/sample_export.docx`.

### Python Modules

#### `main.py`
- Refactored for Pylint compliance: fixed line lengths, added docstrings, and improved import order.
- All imports use relative paths for package consistency.
- Progress bar and workflow logic improved for clarity and maintainability.

#### `analysis.py`
- Reduced the number of local variables in functions.
- Split long lines to comply with Pylint's 100-character limit.
- Added or improved function docstrings.
- Improved logging and summary breakdown logic.

#### `cleaner.py`
- Added comprehensive docstrings to all functions.
- Refactored for clarity and Pylint compliance.
- Ensured no duplicate function definitions.
- Improved multiprocessing logic for data cleaning.

#### `injector.py`
- Refactored for Pylint compliance: fixed import order, removed unused arguments, and added docstrings.
- Now expects templates in the `templates/` directory.
- Functionality is a placeholder for future template injection features.

#### `doc_parser.py`
- Refactored for Pylint compliance: fixed import order, line lengths, and added robust docstrings.
- Improved error handling and logging.
- Cleaned up main execution logic for clarity.

#### `exporter.py`
- Handles exporting cleaned and analyzed data to Word and Excel formats.
