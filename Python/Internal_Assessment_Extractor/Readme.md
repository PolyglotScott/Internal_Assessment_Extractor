## Overview

This project automates the extraction of assessment questions, answers, and marks from DOCX files with specific styling conventions. It supports exporting the extracted data as pandas DataFrames, Word documents with proper formatting, and provides groundwork for integration with CI/CD pipelines.

---

## Features

* Parses DOCX files with predefined styles (e.g., Heading 1, Heading 2) to identify chapters and processes.
* Extracts "CONCEPT CHECK" style questions and answers from tables.
* Aggregates extracted content into structured pandas DataFrames.
* Supports exporting results into Word documents with formatting mimicking original assessment layouts.
* Future planned features include:

  * File browser GUI for local file selection.
  * Printing capabilities.
  * Toggleable automation for CI/CD pipelines.

* **src/parser.py**: Contains logic for reading DOCX files, extracting styled headings, questions, and answers.  
* **src/exporter.py**: Contains functions to export DataFrame content to a Word document with formatting matching assessment layouts.  
* **src/utils.py**: Utility functions to support parsing and formatting operations.  
* **.gitignore**: Configured to ignore sensitive or private input files and environment settings to protect user privacy.  
* **requirements.txt**: Lists required Python packages (`python-docx`, `pandas`, etc.) for easy environment setup.  
* **sample_input.docx** (in `input/` folder): An optional placeholder to demonstrate the expected input format (should be kept out of the repository if containing private data).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or later
* pip package manager
* Microsoft Word (for DOCX file handling)
* Basic knowledge of Python and command line usage
* Familiarity with pandas for data manipulation (optional but helpful)
* Familiarity with Microsoft Word for document formatting and export
* Familiarity with Git for version control and collaboration (optional)
* Familiarity with virtual environments (optional but recommended for dependency management)

### Setup

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/PolyglotScott/internal_assessment_extractor.git`
`cd internal_assessment_extractor`
`git checkout main`
`git pull origin main`

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

`python -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`  (macOS/Linux)
`venv\Scripts\activate`     (Windows)

Install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`pip install python-docx pandas`
`pip install openpyxl` (if using Excel files)

---

## Usage

### Running the Parser

To extract questions and answers from a DOCX file:

`python src/parser.py --input path/to/input.docx`
*Note:* Replace `path/to/input.docx` with the actual path to your DOCX file. The script will parse the document, extract questions and answers, and save them in a structured format.
*Example:*
```bash
python src/parser.py --input input/input_document.docx
```

This will output a pandas DataFrame preview and store the extracted data for further processing.

### Exporting to Word Document

After parsing, export the data with formatting similar to your assessment layout:

`python src/exporter.py --data path/to/extracted_data.pkl --output path/to/output.docx`

*Note:* You may want to test the parsing step first, then export once you confirm data correctness.

### Future Enhancements

* Interactive file browsing GUI
* Direct printing from script
* CI/CD toggles for automation or manual control
* Integration with other tools or platforms (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks, web applications)
* Additional export formats (e.g., PDF, HTML)

---

## File Management and Privacy

Sensitive and private files (e.g., input DOCX containing proprietary content or personal data) should **not** be committed to this repository. Use `.gitignore` to exclude:

* `input/*.docx`
* `output/*`
* Any environment or credential files
* Any other files containing sensitive information
*Note:* The `input/` folder is provided for your convenience, but it should be used with caution. If you need to share the repository, consider using sample files or dummy data instead of real documents.

This practice maintains your privacy and allows you to showcase your code publicly without exposing confidential material.
**If you need to share sensitive files, consider using a secure file-sharing service or encrypting the files before sharing. Always follow your organization's data protection policies when handling sensitive information.*

* Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`)
* Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/my-feature`)
