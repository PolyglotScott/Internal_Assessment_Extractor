## Overview

This project automates the extraction of assessment questions, answers, and marks from DOCX files with specific styling conventions. It supports exporting the extracted data as pandas DataFrames, Word documents with proper formatting, and provides groundwork for integration with CI/CD pipelines.

---

## Features

* Parses DOCX files using heading styles (e.g., Heading 1 for chapters, Heading 2 for processes).
* Optionally cross-checks structure against the Table of Contents (TOC).
* Extracts "CONCEPT CHECK" style questions and answers from tables.
* Aggregates extracted content into structured pandas DataFrames.
* Supports exporting results into Word and Excel documents.
* Modular codebase for easy extension and maintenance.
* Future planned features:
  * File browser GUI for local file selection.
  * Printing capabilities.
  * Toggleable automation for CI/CD pipelines.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or later
* pip package manager

### Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PolyglotScott/internal_assessment_extractor.git
cd internal_assessment_extractor
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Place your DOCX files in the `input/` folder.
2. Run the main script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

By default, the script will use the first `.docx` file found in the `input/` directory.  
You can also run the parser directly and specify an input file:

```bash
python src/parser.py --input input/your_document.docx
```

After parsing, the script will print a summary and can export results to Word or Excel (see `exporter.py`).

## File Management and Privacy

Sensitive and private files (e.g., input DOCX containing proprietary content or personal data) should **not** be committed to this repository. Use `.gitignore` to exclude:

* `input/*.docx`
* `output/*`
* Any environment or credential files
